# sin-cpp

`sin-cpp` is a basic `C++20` library.

# Build

## Dependencies

Mandatory dependencies:
- `C++20` compiler (for compiling)
- `CMake` (for building)
- [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) (for tests)
- [benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) (for benchmarks)
- [sin-cmake](https://github.com/sin-is-nsimd/sin-cmake) (for building)

Optional dependencies:
- `ninja` (for faster building)
- `ccache` (for faster compiling)
- `doxygen` (for documentation)

## For Debian GNU/Linux

You can install theses packages (with `root` access):
```sh
apt install \
  build-essential cmake \
  ninja-build ccache doxygen
```

## For MacOS

TODO

### For Microsoft Windows

`C++` compiler, `CMake` and `ninja` are available in the latest versions of
[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).

The commands given for building in the next sections work in a `PowerShell`
shell after theses commands (you may change the `Visual Studio` path):
```sh
call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64_x86

set PATH=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\VC\SecurityIssueAnalysis\python;%PATH%
```

## Clone `sin-cpp` and Other Dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
git clone https://github.com/google/benchmark.git
git clone https://github.com/sin-is-nsimd/sin-cmake.git
git clone https://github.com/sin-is-nsimd/sin-cpp.git
```

## Build `gtest` and `benchmark`

Build `gtest` (in the `googletest` directory):
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../_install_sincpp
ninja
ninja install
```

Build `benchmark` (in the `benchmark` directory):
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBENCHMARK_ENABLE_LTO=true -DBENCHMARK_ENABLE_GTEST_TESTS=OFF -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../_install_sincpp
ninja
ninja install
```

## Build `sin-cpp`

Build (in the `sin-cpp` directory):
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../_install_sincpp
ninja
ninja install
```

Under `Microsoft Windows`, you may add `-DSINCPP_LIB_TYPE=STATIC -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE="/MT"` arguments to the `cmake` command.

# Development

Project uses `clang-format` as `C++` code formatter.

Project uses [conventional-pre-commit](https://github.com/compilerla/conventional-pre-commit)
to try to force good commit messages.
The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is already in the root folder of `sin-cmake`.
Run this command in the `sin-cmake` directory:
```sh
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```
